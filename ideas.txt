Ideas for a capstone project for SPECS

1. Making a site that checks and compares the prices of items at stores within
an area given by the user. User can create a list of items and filter it based on 
their requirements, and then have the site go through different stores in the area
and create a list of items based off the users input and tell the user what items
are at each store, and whether or not that store has curbside pick up available.

2. Create a learning game for children, that filters the level of content based off
the users age. It can be updated with new content. As the user progresses, it saves
their data for them to pick up where they left off. User can create a customized
avatar that they will use throughout the game while they progress.

3. Build a DIY blog-style site that has information for how to do different projects
or activities. Perhaps a health and well-being area as well. The site would not be
limited to any particular topics.

4. Create an app that can lay out your day for you based on what the user has or 
wants to do for a day. User can also set long term goals, and it will add what to
do for multiple days out at a time. User can edit parts of generated daily tasks
if something doesn't work for them on that day or in general.

5. Build a quiz app that allows users to search for specific topics, or choose a 
random set of questions to answer. User can add own recommendations or quizzes that
would be verified as being accurate.
